## Lab scenario

This setup lab consists of enabling the Microsoft Audit Log and file monitoring capabilities in the Microsoft 365 tenant.

**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes

### Setup - Enable Microsoft 365 audit log and file monitoring

In this setup task, you will enable the Audit log and file monitoring capabilities in Microsoft 365.  

1. Open Microsoft Edge. In the address bar, enter **https://admin.microsoft.com**.

1. Sign in with the admin credentials for the Microsoft 365 tenant provided by your authorized lab hoster (ALH).

1. From the left navigation pane of the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Show all**.

1. Under Admin centers, select **Security**.  A new browser page opens to the welcome page of Microsoft Defender.  

1. From the left navigation panel of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, select **Show all**.

1. In the left navigation panel, scroll down and expand **System**.  From the expanded list, select **Audit**.  Note: the audit functionality is also accessible through the Microsoft Purview portal.

1. Once you land on the Audit page, wait 1-2 minutes.  If Auditing is NOT enabled, you'll see a blue bar on the top of the page that says start recording user and admin activity.  Select **Start recording user and admin activity**.  Once auditing is enabled, the blue bar disappears.  If the blue bar is not present, then auditing is already enabled, and no further action is required.

1. From the left navigation panel, under System, select **Settings**.

1. From the settings page, select **Cloud apps**.   Scroll down, then under Information Protection select **Files**.

1. If not already enabled, select the box next to where it says **Enable file monitoring** then select **Save**.  

1. This concludes the lab setup on the Microsoft 365 tenant.
