## Lab scenario

This setup lab consists of enabling the Microsoft Audit Log and file monitoring capabilities in the Microsoft 365 tenant.

**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes

### Setup - Enable Microsoft 365 audit log and file monitoring

In this setup task, you will enable the Audit log and file monitoring capabilities in Microsoft 365.  

1. Open Microsoft Edge. In the address bar, enter **`https://admin.microsoft.com`**.

1. Sign in with the admin credentials for the Microsoft 365 tenant provided by your authorized lab hoster (ALH).

1. From the left navigation pane of the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Show all**.

1. Under Admin centers, select **Security**.  A new browser page opens to the welcome page of Microsoft Defender.

1. In the left navigation panel, scroll down and expand **System**.  From the expanded list, select **Audit**.  Note: the audit functionality is also accessible through the Microsoft Purview portal.

1. Once you land on the Audit page, wait 1-2 minutes.  If Auditing is NOT enabled, you'll see a blue bar on the top of the page that says start recording user and admin activity.  Select **Start recording user and admin activity**.  Once auditing is enabled, the blue bar disappears.  If the blue bar is not present, then auditing is already enabled, and no further action is required.  If you see a message, "Sorry, we're having trouble figuring out if activity is being recorded. Try refreshing the page," and there is no change after refreshing the page, you'll need to enable audit via PowerShell.
    1. Right-select the blue Windows PowerShell icon on taskbar and select **Run as administrator**.
    1. To confirm that the Exchange Online PowerShell module is installed on the computer, enter **`Get-InstalledModule ExchangeOnlineManagement | Format-List Name,Version,InstalledLocation`**.  You'll see the name, version and installed location of Exchange OnlineManagement.
    1. Now load the module, by entering **`Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement`**.
    1. To connect, enter **`Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName admin@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com`**.  For the UPN, enter the administrator username found in the resources tab of your lab.
    1. You'll be prompted to sign in.  Enter the administrative username and password found in the resources tab of your lab.
    1. To turn on Auditing, enter **`Set-AdminAuditLogConfig -UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled $true`**. A message is displayed saying that it might take up to 60 minutes for the change to take effect.
    1. Although it may take up to 60 minutes to take effect, you can verify the command was received by entering **`Get-AdminAuditLogConfig | FL UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled`**.  If audit is enabled, the property UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled will show a value of true.

1. From the left navigation panel, under System, select **Settings**.

1. From the settings page, select **Cloud apps**.   Scroll down, then under **Information Protection** select **Files**.

1. If not already enabled, select the box next to where it says **Enable file monitoring** then select **Save**.  

1. This concludes the lab setup on the Microsoft 365 tenant.
